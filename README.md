### Neural Style Transfer Web App - [FastAPI + streamlit + Docker]

NST - application based on the Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution paper and Justin Johnson's pre-trained models.

Application implements:

* Develop an asynchronous API with Python and FastAPI
* Serve up a machine learning model with FastAPI
* Develop a UI with Streamlit
* Containerize FastAPI and Streamlit with Docker
* Leverage asyncio to execute code in the background outside the request/response flow
